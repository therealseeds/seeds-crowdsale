      <h6>How do I buy ETH?</h6>
      <p>If you’re new to the crypto-world and are unsure about what steps to take to buy SEEDS, here’s what you need to do:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>First, you’ll need to create a wallet.  We suggest visiting <a target="_blank" href="https://www.myetherwallet.com/">MyEtherWallet</a> and following the simple instructions on their site.</li>
        <li>When MyEtherWallet asks you how to access your wallet, choose ‘private key.’ This will allow you to unlock your wallet to gain access.</li>
        <li>Save your password and private key.  If you lose them, you’ll permanently lose access to your wallet and everything in it.  We suggest you print your password and key and store them in a safe place.</li>
        <li>Now you have a wallet!  However, it’s empty. :)  Your balance is 0 ETH, so you’ll need to click, ‘Buy ETH with USD’ and follow the instructions.  It might up to a few days to receive the ETH that you bought.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>After the ETH hits your wallet, you’re all set to buy Seeds! But how?</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h6>Now that I have ETH, how do I buy SEEDS?</h6>
      <p>Now that you have some ETH, buying SEEDS is easy.  You’ll need to send us ETH at the address given <a href="/contribute">here</a> to cover the cost of the amount of SEEDS you’d like to buy. Go to your wallet, click on the ‘Send’ button, paste our address, confirm your password, and you’re done!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="background-grey">
      <h6>I have BTC but not ETH. How do I buy SEEDS?</h6>
      <p>Unfortunately, we don’t currently accept payments in Bitcoin. In order to buy SEEDS, you need to convert your BTC to ETH first, and then use those to buy SEEDS.  If you feel strongly that we should be supporting payments in BTC as well, please let us know at <a href="mailto:team@playseeds.com">team@playseeds.com</a>. We want to do everything we can to make our community happy.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h6>I have a Coinbase and/or GDAX account.  How do I buy SEEDS?</h6>
      <p>Coinbase wallets don’t allow you to receive custom tokens like SEEDS, so you’ll need to create a wallet that does, using a tool like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.myetherwallet.com/">MyEtherWallet</a>. You can transfer ETH from you Coinbase account to your MyEtherWallet almost instantaneously, and send us the ETH for your SEEDS purchase from there.  If you need more help, we suggest you follow this <a target="_blank" href="https://blockgeeks.com/how-to-setup-an-ethereum-wallet-and-buy-a-custom-token-a-guide-for-coinbase-users/">guide</a>.</p>

    <div class="background-grey">
      <h6>I bought SEEDS but I don't see them in my wallet. Am I missing something?</h6>
      <p>It may take a few hours (or even a few days) for your Seeds Tokens to hit your wallet. And once the tokens have hit, they may still not be immediately visible, because while most wallets are able to receive, send, and store ETH, they don’t have the functionality to see incoming transactions of custom tokens like SEEDS.</p>
      <p>In that case, in order to see your incoming SEEDS tokens, you’ll have to ‘watch’ them. Login to your MyEtherWallet<sup>*</sup> address and click on ‘Add Custom Token.’  Enter the following information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Address: {{tokenAddress}}</li>
        <li>Token Symbol: SEEDS</li>
        <li>Decimals: 10</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Now, you should be able to see your SEEDS tokens in your wallet!</p>
      <p><sup>*</sup>If it’s been more than a few days and they still aren’t there, please email us at <a href="mailto:team@playseeds.com">team@playseeds.com</a>, and we’ll do whatever we can to help.</p>
      <p>Thank you so much!</p>
