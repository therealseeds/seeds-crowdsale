    <h1 class="new-page">Exhibit A</h1>
    <h1>Description of Company, the Seeds Ecosystem, and SEEDS</h1>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3><i>Overview of Company</i></h3>
        <p>Company is a Delaware corporation, incorporated in 2013. In 2014, Company began generating revenue. Company generates revenue by licensing front-end products (the “Seeds Software”) to websites and apps and collecting a percentage of the gross purchase amount derived from the use of the Seeds Software. The Seeds Software is integrated into a web or app developer’s website or app using Company’s front-end products, including drag and drop SDKs and API. Once the Seeds Software is integrated, the website or app prompts users or visitors to make a purchase by attaching that purchase with an opportunity to help others. Company’s research shows that a user or visitor is nearly 60% more likely to make a purchase when attached to the opportunity to help someone else even if the social good is not specifically tailored to the user. Shortly after Company receives its share of the revenue generated from the in-app or in-website purchase, Company wires a small amount to its vetted micro-finance lenders from around the world. Company is developing blockchain services for the Seeds Ecosystem aimed at eliminating this step. The micro-finance lenders then repay the Company according to the terms of a loan agreement executed between the parties.  Company is developing blockchain services in the Seeds Ecosystem to eliminate this step as well. Company will have primary responsibility for administering certain aspects of ongoing development related to SEEDS and the Seeds Ecosystem, including the development of a recommendation algorithm to make more targeted recommendations to users of apps and websites that have integrated the Seeds Software.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3><i>Overview of the Seeds Ecosystem</i></h3>
        <p>The Seeds Ecosystem consists of (1) the Seeds Software; (2) the Seeds System; and (3) SEEDS.</p>
        <p>The Seeds Software include drag and drop SDKs and APIs, which allow developers to integrate the Seeds Software into any app or website. The Seeds Software is free to use—the Company is paid a percentage of the gross sale when a purchase is made. The Seeds Software encourages users to make a purchase by contributing a small amount of the purchase to a social good. The Company has found that the likelihood of purchase increases nearly 60% when the purchase also helps someone in need even when the social good is not targeted to the particular user. This may increase with a more robust recommendation algorithm, which the Company plans to develop.</p>
        <p>The Seeds System  is a blockchain-based platform where users can use SEEDS to submit monetary requests (“Needs Requests”). The Seeds System also features websites and apps that have integrated the Seeds Software, helping drive new users to such businesses. Any user of an app or website that has integrated the Seeds Software (“Seeds Licensors”) may be shown purchase opportunity along with a Needs Request and such user is a potential funder for such Needs Request. The user is encouraged to make a purchase because (i) the user has an opportunity to help fulfill a need and (ii) the user are entered into a lottery to win SEEDS so the user can make their own Needs Request. The Company has found that there is approximately a 60% higher likelihood that someone will make a purchase when that purchase is linked to helping someone even when the need is not specifically targeted to the user. Thus far, the Company estimates that there are approximately 15 million users of Seeds Licensors. Each user of a Seeds Licensor can potentially fulfill a Needs Request.
        </p>
        <p>SEEDS is a decentralized ERC20 token that Company is selling in the Token Sale and may be used to submit a Needs Request on the Seeds System and to earn SEEDS upon fulfilling a Needs Request.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3><i>SEEDS – Token Utility</i></h3>
        <p>SEEDS are used to submit requests for monetary needs (“Needs Requests”) in the Seeds System and to incentivize users of Seeds Licensors to fulfill those needs by allowing such users to earn SEEDS. For example, a user of the Seeds Licensor’s app or website would be shown a purchase opportunity along with the opportunity to help someone who has submitted a Needs Request. If the user makes the purchase, he or she is entered into a lottery to earn SEEDS , allowing him or her to make his or her own requests on the Seeds System.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3><i>Additional Information Regarding the Seeds Ecosystem</i></h3>
        <p>Further details regarding the Seeds Ecosystem is described in the Seeds Whitepaper (“<b>Whitepaper</b>”), which is available at: <a href="https://www.seedstokens.com/SEEDS-white-paper.pdf">https://www.seedstokens.com/SEEDS-white-paper.pdf</a></p>
        <p>Although Company intends for the Seeds Ecosystem and SEEDS to function in the manner generally described above, the company reserves the right to modify features, functionalities or ongoing development plans in its sole and absolute discretion. Moreover, the information provided in the Whitepaper is provided for illustrative and descriptive purposes only, does not form part of these Terms unless expressly incorporated herein, and is subject to modification by Company in its sole and absolute discretion.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h1 class="new-page">Exhibit B</h1>
    <h1>Token Sale Procedures and Specifications</h1>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3><i>Total Number of SEEDS to be Created and Sold</i></h3>
        <p>Company has created total of 1,000,000,000 SEEDS. No additional SEEDS will be created.</p>
        <p>Although subject to change at Company’s discretion, the allocation of SEEDS is expected to be approximately as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>33% will be allocated for sale</li>
          <li>33% will be retained by the Company</li>
          <li>33% will be allocated to partners to incentivize the network</li>
          <li>1% will be used to cover token sale costs and fees</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3><i>Commencement and Duration of Token Sale</i></h3>
        <p>The Token Sale is expected to open on or about 9am on February 28, 2018 (“Token Sale Start Date”).</p>
        <p>The Token Sale is expected to continue until (i) at least one million (1,000,000) SEEDS are sold (the “Minimum Target Amount”) or (ii) 30 calendar days have elapsed, whichever is earlier (either of (i) or (ii), the “Token Sale End Date”). Company reserves the right to modify the Token Sale End Date in its sole discretion, by either ending the Token Sale earlier or extending the Token Sale End Date for an additional period of days.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3><i>SEEDS Price</i></h3>
        <p>The price of each SEEDS shall be posted at www.seedstokens.com.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3><i>Registration and Other Procedures for Buying SEEDS in the Token Sale</i></h3>
        <p>To participate in the Token Sale, you must undergo the Token Sale registration process described herein (“Registration”). Registration is expected to begin at the same time the Token Sale commences.</p>
        <p>Before beginning Registration, you must have an ERC-20 compatible Purchaser Wallet.</p>
        <p>To begin Registration, you must access the Registration webpage at www.seedstokens.com. To complete Registration, you must provide all Registration Information requested and review, agree to and comply with these Terms. Registration Information is currently expected to include first name, last name, entity (if applicable), date of birth, email address, physical address, and IP address. We reserve the right to request additional Registration Information, and to deny attempts to register for the Token Sale, at our sole and absolute discretion.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3><i>SEEDS Purchase and Delivery</i></h3>
        <p>SEEDS is expected to be delivered to the Purchaser Wallet address that sent the Ether purchase amount to the SEEDS Token Sale address as soon as the applicable Ether transfer block clears. Title to and risk of loss of SEEDS passes to you once the SEEDS are delivered from the SEEDS Token Sale address to such Purchaser Wallet address.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3><i>Use of Proceeds from SEEDS Token Sale</i></h3>
        <p>We intend to use the proceeds of the Token Sale for the ongoing development of the Seeds Ecosystem, as outlined in the Company’s Whitepaper (referenced in Exhibit A). However, there are no restrictions on how the Company may use the proceeds of the Token Sale. The Whitepaper is provided for illustrative and descriptive purposes only, does not form part of these Terms unless expressly incorporated herein, and is subject to modification by Company in its sole and absolute discretion.</p>
      </li>

    </ol>


    <h1 class="new-page">Exhibit C</h1>
    <h1>Certain Risks Relating to Purchase, Sale and Use of SEEDS</h1>

    <p><i><b>Important Note</b>: As noted elsewhere in these Terms, SEEDS are not being designed or sold as currency, securities or any other form of investment product. Accordingly, none of the information presented in this Exhibit C is intended to form the basis for any investment decision, and no specific recommendations are intended. Company expressly disclaims any and all responsibility for any direct or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever arising directly or indirectly from: (i) reliance on any information contained in this Exhibit C, (ii) any error, omission or inaccuracy in any such information or (iii) any action resulting from such information.</i></p>

    <p><b>By purchasing, holding and using SEEDS, you expressly acknowledge and assume the following risks:</b></p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3><i>Risk of Losing Access to SEEDS Due to Loss of Private Key(s), Custodial Error or Purchaser Error</i></h3>
          <p>A private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to control and dispose of SEEDS stored in your Purchaser Wallet or other digital wallet or vault. Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s) associated with your Purchaser Wallet or other digital wallet or vault storing SEEDS will result in loss of such SEEDS. Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private key(s), including by gaining access to login credentials of your Purchaser Wallet or other digital wallet or vault service you use, may be able to misappropriate your SEEDS. Any errors or malfunctions caused by or otherwise related to your Purchaser Wallet or other digital wallet or vault you choose to receive and store SEEDS, including your own failure to properly maintain or use such Purchaser Wallet or other digital wallet or vault, may also result in the loss of your SEEDS. Additionally, your failure to follow precisely the procedures set forth in Exhibit B for buying and receiving SEEDS may result in the loss of your SEEDS.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3><i>Risks Associated with the Ethereum Blockchain</i></h3>
        <p>Because SEEDS is based on the Ethereum blockchain, any malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of the Ethereum blockchain may have a material adverse effect on SEEDS. Moreover, advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computing, could present risks to SEEDS, including the use of SEEDS for Token Utility, by rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3><i>Risk of Mining Attacks</i></h3>
        <p>As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens based on the Ethereum blockchain, SEEDS are susceptible to attacks by miners in the course of validating SEEDS transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, including, but not limited, to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, and selfish-mining attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to SEEDS, including, but not limited to, accurate execution and recording of transactions involving SEEDS.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3><i>Risk of Hacking and Security Weaknesses</i></h3>
        <p>Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the Seeds Ecosystem or SEEDS in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. This could negatively influence the Seeds Ecosystem and SEEDS, including SEEDS use for Token Utility.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3><i>Risks Associated with Markets for SEEDS</i></h3>
        <p>SEEDS are intended to be used solely in connection with the Seeds System, and Company does not support or otherwise facilitate any secondary trading or external valuation of SEEDS. This restricts the contemplated avenues for using SEEDS, and could therefore create illiquidity risk with respect to SEEDS you hold. Even if secondary trading of SEEDS is facilitated by third party exchanges, such exchanges may be relatively new and subject to little or no regulatory oversight, making them more susceptible to market-related risks. Furthermore, to the extent that third parties do ascribe an external exchange value to SEEDS (e.g., as denominated in a digital or fiat currency), such value may be extremely volatile and diminish to zero.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3><i>Risk of Uninsured Losses</i></h3>
        <p>Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions, SEEDS are uninsured unless you specifically obtain private insurance to insure them. Thus, in the event of loss or loss of utility value, there is no public insurer, such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or private insurance arranged by us, to offer recourse to you.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3><i>Risks Associated with Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions</i></h3>
        <p>The regulatory status of SEEDS and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulation with respect to such technology and its applications. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether legislatures or regulatory agencies may implement changes to law and regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, including the Platforms and SEEDS. Regulatory actions could negatively impact the Platforms and SEEDS in various ways, including, for purposes of illustration only, through a determination that the purchase, sale, delivery or use of SEEDS constitutes unlawful activity, or that registration or licensing is required for SEEDS or for some or all of the parties involved in the purchase, sale, delivery or use of SEEDS. Company may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals to operate in such jurisdiction.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3><i>Risks Arising from Taxation</i></h3>
        <p>The tax characterization of SEEDS is uncertain. You must seek your own tax advice in connection with purchasing SEEDS, which may result in adverse tax consequences to you, including withholding taxes, income taxes and tax reporting requirements.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3><i>Risk of Competition from Similar Companies</i></h3>
        <p>It is possible that a company offering a similar product or products as the Company will enter into market and developers may use their software instead of the Seeds Software in their apps or websites, which could limit or decrease the number of users exposed to a Needs Request and could negatively impact the chances of a Needs Request being fulfilled.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3><i>Risk of Insufficient Interest in the Seeds Front-End Products and Risk of Not Getting Needs Requests Fulfille</i></h3>
        <p>It is possible that developers will not use the Seeds Software in their apps or websites or that the users of sites will not make purchases when prompted to by the Seeds Software, potentially leaving Needs Request(s) unfulfilled.  Such lack of use limit the number of potential funders of a Needs Request. Additionally, integration of the Seeds Software does not guarantee that a Needs Request will be fulfilled as it is dependent on the users making purchases on apps or websites that have integrated the Seeds Software.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3><i>Risks Associated with the Development of the Seeds System</i></h3>
        <p>Although the Seeds System will be deployed and operational at or shortly following the Token Sale, the Seeds Ecosystem is still subject to ongoing development and may undergo significant changes over time. Whether other developers will integrate the Seeds Software is out of Company’s control. This could create the risk that SEEDS, the Seeds System, and the use of SEEDS in the Seeds System and the Seeds Ecosystem, as further developed and used, may not meet your expectations at the time of purchasing SEEDS. It is also possible that the Seeds Software or the Seeds System will experience malfunctions or otherwise fail to be adequately developed over time, which may negatively impact the Seeds Ecosystem and the potential utility of SEEDS, including its use for Token Utility. Additionally, if the Seeds System ceases to operate, SEEDS would no longer have any utility unless or until a new platform where SEEDS can be used for its Token Utility is developed. Further, if the Seeds Software or the Seeds System malfunctions, there is a risk that the SEEDS Token Utility will be compromised.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3><i>Risk of an Unfavorable Fluctuation of Ether and Other Currency Value</i></h3>
        <p>The Company team intends to use the proceeds from selling SEEDS to contribute to the ongoing development of the Seeds Ecosystem, as described further in Exhibits A and B. The proceeds of the Token Sale will be denominated in Ether, and may, at Company’s discretion, be converted into other cryptographic and fiat currencies. If the value of Ether or other currencies fluctuates unfavorably during or after the Token Sale, the Company team may not be able to contribute to ongoing development of the Seeds Ecosystem in the manner that it intended.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3><i>Risk of Dissolution of the Company</i></h3>
        <p>It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, an unfavorable fluctuation in the value of Ether (or other cryptographic and fiat currencies), decrease in SEEDS utility (including its use for Token Utility), the failure of commercial relationships, or intellectual property ownership challenges, the Company may dissolve, which may adversely impact the utility of SEEDS.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3><i>Risks Arising from Lack of Governance Rights in Company </i></h3>
        <p>Because SEEDS confer no governance rights of any kind with respect to Company, all decisions involving the Company will be made by Company at its sole discretion, including, but not limited to, decisions to discontinue contributions to the Seeds Ecosystem’s ongoing development or to sell or liquidate the Company. As noted above, the consequences of those decisions could adversely impact the utility of SEEDS that you hold, including SEEDS’ use for Token Utility.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3><i>Risks Associated with New and Evolving Laws Impacting Decentralized Application Technology</i></h3>
        <p>The distributed ledger and decentralized application ecosystem, and by extension the Seeds System, may be subject to a variety of federal, state and international laws and regulations, including those with respect to financial services, consumer privacy, data protection, consumer protection, content regulation, network neutrality, cyber security, intellectual property (including copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws), and others. These laws and regulations, and the interpretation or application of these laws and regulations, could change. In addition, new laws or regulations affecting the Seeds System could be enacted, which could adversely impact the Company, the Seeds System and SEEDS, including SEEDS’s use for Token Utility.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the users and developers of the Seeds System may be subject to industry-specific laws and regulations or licensing requirements. If any of these parties fails to comply with any of these licensing requirements or other applicable laws or regulations, or if such laws and regulations or licensing requirements become more stringent or are otherwise expanded, it could adversely impact the Seeds System and SEEDS, including SEEDS’ use for Token Utility.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3><i>Unanticipated Risks</i></h3>
        <p>Cryptographic tokens such as SEEDS are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks included in this Exhibit C, there are other risks associated with your purchase, holding and use of SEEDS, including those that the Company cannot anticipate. Such risks may further materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed in this Exhibit C.</p>
